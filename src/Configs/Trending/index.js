      `SASE refers to the whole framework, not a specific technology. Gartner, in its 2019 report "The Future of Network Security is in the Cloud," 
      defined the SASE framework as a cloud-based cybersecurity solution that offers "comprehensive WAN capabilities with comprehensive network security functions
       (such as SWG, CASB, FWaaS, and ZTNA) to support the dynamic secure access needs of digital enterprises." `,
    subtitle2: `SASE is one of the most broadly accepted phrases, and we at GSV have implemented 
      the SASE solution for multiple Enterprise Customers & Datacenters to ensure secure connectivity over the Public Internet.  `,

    subtitle: `Post-COVID, SD-WAN has become far more critical as businesses shut down offices, driving either a hybrid work environment or a complete work-from-home (WFH) strategy. WFH went from temporary to permanent for many companies, which redefined the network edge`,
    subtitle2: `VPNs, often the point-to-point solution for remote workers, gave way to always-on SD-WAN appliances for many tasks as the network edge extended into employees' homes. With businesses becoming more distributed, they have accelerated their migration plans to SD-WAN because of the improved experience and security for their WFH workforce.`,

    subtitle2: `WiFi6 delivers four times higher capacity and 75 percent lower latency, much better than earlier versions and operates in the 6 GHz band. At the same time, the 6E version also works in the same band with better design to process more data and support new technologies such as augmented/virtual reality cloud computing and telepresence.`,

Network automation is increasingly required to manage modern, dynamic network complexities and orchestrate services efficiently and effectively. The end goal of network automation is to create" zero-touch" or autonomous networks.`,
